Background and Purpose: To investigate whether the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Profile (FCRP) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) are associated with cortical volume and thickness. Results: 152 subjects (82 men) were aged 78 (7) years old, 94 had a CDR of 0, 58 had a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0.5 and the mean mini-mental status examination (MMSE) was 28 2. FCRP score was inversely associated with total gray matter (GM) volume, parietal and temporal GM volume (adjusted p<0.04). FCRP was inversely associated with parietal and total cerebral GM thickness (adjusted p<0.03). CIMT was inversely associated with thickness of parietal GM only (adjusted p=0.04). Including history of myocardial infarction or stroke and radiologic evidence of brain infarction, or apoE genotype did not alter relationships with FCRP or CIMT. Conclusions: Increased cardiovascular risk was associated with reduced GM volume and thickness in regions also affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), independent of infarcts and apoE genotype. These results suggest a double hit toward developing dementia when someone with incipient AD also has high cardiovascular risk. Subjects: Consecutive subjects were identified from an ongoing, longitudinal, multi-institutional Aging Brain program project that recruits subjects with normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment, representing a spectrum of low to high vascular risk14. Most participants were acquired through community-based recruitment using a protocol designed to obtain a demographically diverse cohort, or through sources such as stroke clinics and support groups attended by people with high vascular risk factors. All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the policies of each institutional review board. Inclusion criteria include age 60 or older, with cognitive function in the normal to mild cognitive impairment range (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score of 0 or 0.5) 15. Persons with history of multiple vascular risk factors, coronary or carotid disease, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke were targeted for inclusion, although patients with very large strokes that interfered with estimation of cortical volume and thickness were excluded. Exclusion criteria included evidence of alcohol or substance abuse, head trauma with loss of consciousness lasting longer than 15 minutes, factors contraindicating MRI, and severe medical illness, neurologic or psychiatric disorders unrelated to AD or vascular dementia that could significantly affect brain structure (e.g., schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, current major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, liver disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Participant demographics by CDR are shown in Table 1. Measures of cardiovascular risk and carotid atherosclerosis: The FCRP uses empirically-derived age- and gender-adjusted weighting of categorical variables to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease and is a weighted sum of: age, gender, active smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure (and/or use of hypertensive medications) and total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels13. Higher scores indicate greater coronary risk. CIMT was used as a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. CIMT is a measures of the thickness of the inner two layers of the carotid artery; higher CIMT indicates greater atherosclerosis burden. High-resolution B-mode ultrasound images of the right and left common carotid arteries were obtained with a 7.5-MHz linear array transducer attached to an ATL Apogee ultrasound system (Bothell, WA). CIMT was determined as the average of 70 to 100 measurements between the intima-lumen and media-adventitia interfaces along a 1 cm length just proximal to the carotid artery bulb at the same point of the cardiac cycle using comperterized automated edge detection. Right and left CIMT were measured in each individual whenever possible. For individuals with CIMT measurements from both sides, the maximum of these two quantities was used in subsequent statistical analyses. Measure of AD risk: Blood was drawn with the subject's consent for apolipoprotein E genotyping. Genotyping was completed for 102 participants. Subjects with 3/4 or 4/4 combined alleles were classified as apoE e4 positive, and those with 3/3 alleles as apoE e4 negative. Because the 2/4 combined allele is associated with a lower risk of AD16, these subjects were not included in the APOE e4 positive group. Consecutive subjects participating in a prospective cohort study of aging and mild cognitive impairment enriched for vascular risk factors for atherosclerosis underwent structural MRI scans at 3T and 4T MRI at three sites. Freesurfer (v5.1) was used to obtain regional measures of neocortical volumes (mm3) and thickness (mm). Multiple linear regression was used to determine the association of FCRP and CIMT with cortical volume and thickness. MRI: acquisition: Structural T1-weighted MRI scans for participants were collected on 3T and 4T MRI systems. Forty-three participants were scanned at the University of Southern California using a 3T General Electric Signal HDx system with an 8-channel head coil. Acquired images included a T1-weighted volumetric SPGR (TR = 7 ms, TE = 2.9 ms, TI= 650 ms, 1 mm3 isotropic resolution). Fifty-four participants were scanned at the University of California, Davis research center. Nine participants were scanned using a 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio Syngo System with an 8-channel head coil. Forty-five were scanned using a 3T Siemens Magnetom TrioTim system with an 8-channel head coil. Acquired images for all 54 participants included a T1-weighted volumetric MP-RAGE (TR = 2500, TE = 2.98, TI = 1100, 1 mm3 isotropic resolution). Thirty-three participants were scanned at the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center using a 4T Siemens MedSpec Syngo System with an 8-channel head coil. A T1-weighted volumetric MP-RAGE scan (TR = 2300, TE = 2.84, TI = 950, 1 mm3 isotropic resolution) was acquired. Twenty-two participants were scanned at the University of California, San Francisco Neuroscience Imaging Center using a 3T Siemens Magnetom TrioTim system with a 12-channel head coil. Acquired images included a T1-weighted volumetric MP-RAGE (TR = 2500, TE = 2.98, TI = 1100, 1 mm3 isotropic resolution). MRI: processing: The publicly available Freesurfer v5.1 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) volumetric segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction methods were used to obtain regional measures of neocortical volumes (mm3) and thickness (mm). The reconstructed cortical surface models for each participant were manually inspected to ensure segmentation accuracy; regions with poor segmentation accuracy due to poor image quality or misregistration were excluded from further statistical analyses. Cortical surfaces were automatically parcellated17 and combined to create average cortical thickness and volume for total GM and for frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobar regions.

ark+=b7272=q6154f00,"CSF Biomarker and PIB-PET Derived Beta-Amyloid Signature Predicts Metabolic, Grey Matter and Cognitive Changes in Non-Demented Subjects","Beta-amyloid (A is a histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease dementia, but high levels of A in the brain can also be found in a substantial proportion of nondemented subjects. Here we investigated which 2-year rate of brain and cognitive changes are present in nondemented subjects with high and low A levels, as assessed with cerebrospinal fluid and molecular positron emission tomography (PET)-based biomarkers of A. In subjects with mild cognitive impairment, increased brain A levels were associated with significantly faster cognitive decline, progression of gray matter atrophy within temporal and parietal brain regions, and a trend for a faster decline in parietal Fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET metabolism. Changes in gray matter and FDG-PET mediated the association between A and cognitive decline. In contrast, elderly cognitively healthy controls (HC) with high A levels showed only a faster medial temporal lobe and precuneus volume decline compared with HC with low A. In conclusion, the current results suggest not only that both functional and volumetric brain changes are associated with high A years before the onset of dementia but also that HC with substantial A levels show higher A pathology resistance, lack other pathologies that condition neurotoxic effects of A, or accumulated A for a shorter time period. Subjects: The study included 465 subjects of which 124 were elderly cognitively HC subjects, 229 subjects were diagnosed with amnestic MCI and 112 subjects had probable AD, recruited within the North American multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, for database, see www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the researchapproximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org. The current sample was restricted to those subjects who had either a PIB-PET assessment or a CSF-A-1-42 measurement. Within this subset, PIB-PET was available in 103 subjects including 19 HC, 65 MCI, and 19 AD subjects. The CSF-A-1-42 concentration was assessed in a total of 116 HC, 199 MCI, and 102 AD subjects (see Fig. 1 for further information on subjects and data inclusion). Within 55 subjects, both CSF Ab1--42 and PIB-PET were assessed. The observation interval covered 2 years, where neuropsychological assessment, FDG-PET scanning, and MRI acquisition was conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 month. All collected data are freely accessible online to researchers (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). General inclusion criteria included an age between 55 and 90 years, a modified Hachinski score =4, education of at least 6 grade level, and stable treatment of at least 4 weeks in case of treatment with permitted medication (for full list, see http://www.adni-info.org, Procedures Manual). The diagnosis of AD was made according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al. 1984). Inclusion criteria for AD encompassed subjective memory complaint, memory impairment as assessed by an education adjusted score on delayed recall of a single paragraph recall from the Wechsler Logical Memory II Subscale as follows: 07 years of education, =2; for 815 years, =4; for 16 years or more, =8, a Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score between 20 and 26, and a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of 0.5 or 1. For the diagnosis of amnestic MCI, the subjects had to show subjective memory impairment and objective memory impairment identical to that for AD, a CDR of 0.5 including the memory box score of 0.5 or greater, and a MMSE score between 24 and 30, with unimpaired general cognitive ability and functional performance such that they did not meet criteria for dementia. HC had to show normal performance on the Logical Memory II Subscale adjusted for education as follows: 07 years, =3, 815 years, =5; 16 or more years, =9, and absence of significant impairment on cognitive function or activities of daily living (Ewers et al. 2010). CSF Measurement: All CSF samples collected at the different centers were shipped on dry ice to the Penn ADNI Biomarker Core Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, for storage at -80C until further analysis at the laboratory. More details on data collection of the CSF samples can be found at http://www.adni-info.org, under ADNI study procedures. The CSF concentration of A-1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181 were measured in the baseline CSF samples using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Lumnix Corp, Austin, TX) at the Penn ADNI Biomarker Core Laboratory. For detailed description, see Shaw et al. (2009). PIB-PET, FDG-PET, MRI Acquisition, and ROI Measurement: All MRI data were acquired on 1.5-T MRI scanners using a volumetric T1-weighted sequences to map brain structures, optimized for the different scanners as indicated at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Research/Cores/index (Jack, Bernstein, et al. 2008). Freesurfer software version 4.5 (Dale et al. 1999; Fischl et al. 1999) was employed to measure longitudinal changes in regional brain volumes. Briefly, the image-processing pipeline using FreeSurfer consisted of five stages: an affine registration with Talairach space, an initial volumetric labeling, bias field correction, nonlinear alignment to the Talairach space, and a final labeling of the volume. The fully automated labeling of volumes is achieved by warping a population based brain atlas to the target brain and by maximizing an a posteriori probability of the labels given specific constraints. A full description of the FreeSurfer processing steps can be found in (Fischl et al. 2002). The procedures have been extensively validated. MRI-volume ROIs were selected based on the previous meta-analyses on MRI gray matter volume measures that were most predictive of AD, including the hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, parahippocampus, entorhinal cortex, inferior parietal lobe, precuneus, and thalamus (Schroeter et al. 2009). PET data were acquired on multiple instruments of varying resolution. PIB scans were collected as 4  5 min frames beginning 50 min after injection of tracer. FDG scans were collected as 6  5 min frames beginning 30 min after injection of approximately 5 mCi of tracer. Attenuation correction was performed either via transmission scan or computer tomography. Images were uploaded to the Laboratory of Neuroimaging where they were processed to provide standard orientation, voxel size, and resolution.  FDG-PET ROIs were constructed based on a meta-analysis of the location of FDG-PET changes in the brain that are typically affected in AD as described previously (Jagust et al. 2009; Landau et al. 2009). FDG uptake was normalized to a reference region composed of the pons and cerebellum and measured in the target ROIs that included bilateral angular gyrus, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and inferior temporal cortex as described previously (Jagust et al. 2009). PIB-PET uptake was normalized to the cerebellum to generate maps of the PIB-PET score used for further statistical analysis. Target ROIs were drawn on a structural MRI template from a single 79-year-old MCI subject scanned at the University of Pittsburgh. This image was deemed an average older subject with typical atrophy and ventricular size. Each subject's PIB-PET score map was coregistered to the individual MRI with SPM5 that was normalized to the MCI template with SPM5 and permitted the transformation of the subject's PIB-PET to the template space. ROIs in which PIB uptake is known to predominate were averaged in left and right hemispheres and comprised of prefrontal, lateral temporal, anterior cingulate gyrus, parietal and posterior cingulate/precuneus. Further information is available at the ADNI webpage (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/). Neuropsychological Tests: Global cognitive ability was assessed with the neuropsychological test battery Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scalecognitive section (ADAS-cog) (Rosen et al. 1984). The ADAS-cog score is the total score on a number of tests on learning and memory, language production, language comprehension, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, and orientation (see ADNI procedures manual for details at http://www.adni-info.org/Scientists/ProceduresManuals.aspx). A higher score on ADAS-cog scores indicates lower cognitive performance. Episodic memory was assessed with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), using the score on the 30-min delayed recall of a list of 15 words that had been repeatedly presented and recalled during the learning phase of 5 verbal presentations of the list (Rey 1964). The test score corresponds to the number of words recalled on the 30-min delayed test. For details on the administration and scoring, see the Procedures Manual (http://www.adni-info.org/Scientists/ProceduresManuals.aspx).",Adult Male Female Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging Brain Human Aged Amyloid Cerebral-Spinal-Fluid Positron-Emission-Tomography Pathology A-Beta FDG-PET Glucose-Metabolism Atrophy

ark+=b7272=q66q1v54,"Gulf War Illness","Some veterans who served in the Gulf War subsequently complained of a wide variety of physical and neuro-psychological symptoms, termed Gulf War Illness (GWI). Several investigators have attributed these symptoms to stress. In contrast, Haley and coworkers reported clusters of symptoms into three primary syndromes and reported reductions of the neuronal marker N- Acetyl aspartate (NAA, a marker of neuron integrity and density) in the basal ganglia and pons of some GWI subjects. Based on this and other data they suggested that GWI has a neurological component. One limitation of previous studies is that post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depresssion, and alcoholism also cause structural and metabolic changes in the brain; the previous studies did not carefully control for these confounds. The primary goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that: subjects with GWI have metabolic and/or morphological changes in their brain, which are not accounted for by confounds such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol abuse, and depression. A secondary goal was to determine: if these brain changes correlate with CNS signs and symptoms of GWI. This project studied 200 subjects with GWI and 200 Gulf War Veteran (GWV) controls drawn from Northern California and surrounding regions. GWI was defined by the same criteria used in previous VA cooperative studies. The extent of alcohol abuse and PTSD symptoms was measured.

The main objective of this study was to gain insight into the heterogeneity of age-related diffusion changes in human brain white matter by analyzing relationships between the diffusion measures in terms of concordance and discordance instead of evaluating them separately, which is difficult to interpret. Fifty-one cognitively normal subjects (22-79 years old) were studied with DTI at 4 Tesla. Age was associated with widespread concordant changes of decreased FA and increased MD but in some regions significant FA reductions occurred discordant to MD changes. Prominent age-related FA reductions were primarily related to greater radial (D(?)) than axial (D(||)) diffusivity changes, potentially reflecting processes of demyelination. In conclusion, concordant/discordant changes of DTI indices provide additional characterization of white matter alterations that accompany normal aging. The dataset available here consists of Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Axial Diffusivity (I1), and Radial Diffusivity (Dra) images as well as subject-study-specific normalization images (B0, see methods in paper) in Analyze format.

We examined female condom counseling and provision among providers in South Africa and Zimbabwe, high HIV-prevalence countries. Design: Cross-sectional study using a nationally-representative survey. Setting: All facilities that provide family planning or HIV/STI services in the two countries. Participants: National probability sample of 1,444 nurses and physicians who provide family planning or HIV/STI services. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Female condom practices with different female patients, including adolescents, married women, women using hormonal contraception, and by HIV status. Using multivariable logistic analysis, we measured variations in condom counseling by provider characteristics. Results: Most providers reported offering female condoms (88%), but perceived a need for novel female barrier methods for HIV/STI prevention (85%). By patient type, providers reported less frequent female condom counseling of adolescents (55%), women using hormonal contraception (65%), and married women (66%), compared to unmarried (74%) or HIV-positive women (82%). Multivariable results showed providers in South Africa were less likely to counsel women on female condoms than in Zimbabwe (OR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.35-0.68, p= 0.001). However, South African providers were more likely to counsel women on male condoms (OR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.57-3.65, p= 0.001). Nurses counseled patients on female condoms more frequently than physicians (OR=5.41, 95% CI: 3.26-8.98, p= 0.001). HIV training, family planning training, provider location (urban vs. rural), and facility type (hospital vs. clinic) were not associated with greater condom counseling. Conclusions: Female condoms were integrated into provider counseling and care, although providers reported a need for new female-initiated multipurpose prevention technologies, suggesting female condoms do not meet all patient/provider needs or are not adequately well-known or accessible. Providers should be included in HIV training efforts to raise awareness of new and existing products, and encouraged to educate all women.

ark+=b7272=q6cc0xmh,"White matter damage in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease measured by diffusion MRI","Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease are sometimes difficult to differentiate clinically because of overlapping symptoms. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) can be useful in distinguishing the different patterns of white matter degradation between the two dementias. In this study, we performed MRI scans in a 4 Tesla MRI machine including T1-weighted structural images and diffusion tensor images in 18 patients with FTD, 18 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 19 cognitively normal (CN) controls. FA was measured selectively in specific fibre tracts (including corpus callosum, cingulum, uncinate and corticospinal tracts) as well as globally in a voxel-by-voxel analysis. Patients with FTD were associated with reductions of FA in frontal and temporal regions including the anterior corpus callosum (P < 0.001), bilateral anterior (left P < 0.001; right P = 0.005), descending (left P < 0.001; right P = 0.003) cingulum tracts, and uncinate tracts (left P < 0.001; right P = 0.005), compared to controls. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were associated with reductions of FA in parietal, temporal and frontal regions including the left anterior (P = 0.003) and posterior (P = 0.002) cingulum tracts, bilateral descending cingulum tracts (P < 0.001) and left uncinate tracts (P < 0.001) compared to controls. When compared with Alzheimer's disease, FTD was associated with greater reductions of FA in frontal brain regions, whereas no region in Alzheimer's disease showed greater reductions of FA when compared to FTD. In conclusion, the regional patterns of anisotropy reduction in FTD and Alzheimer's disease compared to controls suggest a characteristic distribution of white matter degradation in each disease. Moreover, the white matter degradation seems to be more prominent in FTD than in Alzheimer's disease. Taken together, the results suggest that white matter degradation measured with DTI may improve the diagnostic differentiation between FTD and Alzheimer's disease. The dataset available here consists of Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) images in Analyze format. There are FA & MD images for 55 subjects (some subjects have two timepoints, as indicated by a -1 or -2 following subject ID in the filename, please disregard timepoint 2 at this time), and a spreadsheet describing each subjects age (at time of scan), gender, diagnosis (Normal Control, Alzheimers Dissease, or Frontotemporal Dementia), ApoE alleles, and Mini-Mental State Exam score.

The primary goal of this study was to determine if DTI detects progression of the corticospinal tracts (CST) degeneration in ALS. Seventeen ALS patients and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were scanned with DTI at baseline for cross-sectional analyses. For longitudinal analyses, the ALS patients had repeat DTI scans after eight months. Tractography of the CST was used to guide regions-of-interest (ROI) analysis and complemented by a voxelwise analysis. Cross-sectional study found that baseline FA of the right superior CST was markedly reduced in ALS patients compared to controls. The FA reductions in this region correlated with the disease severity in ALS patients. Longitudinal study found that FA change rate of the right superior CST significantly declined over time. In conclusion, longitudinal DTI study captures progression of upper motor fiber degeneration in ALS. DTI can be useful for monitoring ALS progression and efficacy of treatment interventions.

Background and Purpose: To determine if a voxel-wise co-analysis of structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) together reveals additional brain regions affected in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) than voxel-wise analysis of the individual MRI modalities alone.  Conclusion: These results suggest that in corpus callosum and temporal regions macro- and microstructural variations in MCI can be congruent, providing potentially new insight into the mechanisms of brain tissue degeneration.  Methods: Twenty-one patients with MCI, 21 patients with AD, and 21 cognitively normal healthy elderly were studied with MRI. Maps of deformation and fractional anisotropy (FA) were computed and used as dependent variables in univariate and multivariate statistical models. Results: Univariate voxel-wise analysis of macrostructural changes in MCI showed atrophy in the right anterior temporal lobe, left posterior parietal/precuneus region, WM adjacent to the cingulate gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, consistent with prior research. Univariate voxel-wise analysis of microstructural changes in MCI showed reduced FA in the left posterior parietal region extending into the corpus callosum, consistent with previous work. The multivariate analysis, which provides more information than univariate tests when structural and FA measures are correlated, revealed additional MCI-related changes in corpus callosum and temporal lobe.  Participants: Participants were recruited by advertisements in the community or referred by one of several memory clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the Memory Disorders Clinic at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Memory and Aging Center at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Memory Disorders Clinic at the California Pacific Medical Center, for inclusion in one of several studies. Study procedures include a neurological exam, structural MRI, diffusion MRI, and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. In compliance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association and the Declaration of Helsinki, study procedures were approved by review boards of the University of California San Francisco and the San Francisco VA Medical Center, explained to all participants, written informed consent was obtained. From the larger population studied, only participants with artifact-free structural and diffusion MRI were included. Twenty-one patients met Petersen's criteria for MCI, age: 71  8 yrs, 11 women, MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination): 29  2. These patients were gender matched with 21 cognitively normal healthy elderly controls (CN), age: 70  7 yrs, 11 women, MMSE 29  1. The MCI patients were also gender matched with 21 patients who met AD criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA), age: 69  9, 11 women, MMSE 21  7. As evidenced by the high MMSE scores, the MCI patients were in an early stage of cognitive deficits and far less impaired than the AD patients.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition: All scans were performed on a 4 Tesla (Bruker/Siemens) MRI system with a birdcage transmit and 8 channel receive coil arranged in the same housing. The scans included T1-weighted and T2-weighted structural MRI data for measurements of brain macro-structure and diffusion tensor MRI for measurement of micro-structure. T1-weighted images were obtained with a 3D volumetric magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence, TR/TE/TI=2300/3/950 ms, timing; 7 flip angle; 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 mm3 resolution; 157 continuous sagittal slices; acquisition time of 5 min. T2-weighted images were acquired with a variable flip (VFL) angle turbo spin-echo sequence with TR/TE = 4000/30 ms and with the same resolution matrix and field of view of MPRAGE. DTI was based on a dual spin-echo refocused echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence supplemented with parallel imaging acceleration (GRAPPA) (Griswold et al., 2002) with a factor 2 to reduce susceptibility distortions. Other imaging parameters were: TR/TE=6000/77 ms; 2 x 2 mm2 in-plane resolution; 40 continuous 3 mm slices. A reference image (no diffusion gradient b=0) and six diffusion-weighted images (b=800s/mm2 along six non-collinear direction) were acquired. Four DTI scans were acquired and averaged after motion correction to boost signal-to-noise. The total acquisition time of DTI was 4 min.  MRI pre-processing: An expectation maximization segmentation (EMS) algorithm including correction for intensity inhomogeneity 30,31 was applied to T1 weighted MRI, separating skull, scalp, extra-cranial tissue from the rest of brain image volume. Each individual skull-stripped and bias field corrected brain image volume was affine registered to a reference brain image to adjust for global differences in brain positioning and scale across individuals. For this study, an unbiased average brain image was used as the reference. The unbiased average brain was generated from 10 healthy elderly individual brains (i.e., age of 50 to 70) that were not part of the CN group using an unbiased atlas formation technique based on large deformations mapping 32. A large deformation diffeomorphic mapping algorithm using fluid-flow registration 33 was used to register individual scans to standard image space of the unbiased atlas brain. The Jacobian determinant of this transformation was computed at each voxel (resolution 1x1x1 mm3), giving the pattern of volume change required to force the individual anatomy to conform to the reference. The Jacobian images were log transformed to achieve a more normal distribution and then smoothed using a Gaussian filter (FWHM=10 mm) to create tissue volume maps (JAC), where the value at each voxel represents the tissue volume relative to the reference (e.g., a voxel value of 0.06 denotes a volume volrefx100.06, or about 15 percent greater than the reference voxel)  DTI pre-processing: The pre-processing pipeline aims to align a set of DTI images with the corresponding structural data through the following steps. Diffusion tensor images were corrected for eddy currents and head motion 34. Based on a mutual information metric, the T2-weighted image was rigidly aligned to the B0 image, which is a DTI maps without diffusion sensing gradients (b=0 s/mm2). A variational image-based approach was used to calculate a deformation field from the B0 image to the rigidly aligned T2-weighted image to correct for susceptibility artifacts (i.e., nonlinear geometric distortion in DTI) 35. We selected a variational approach for EPI distortion correction over the conventional field map approach, because studies have shown that the local deformations in EPI are best handled with a dense displacement field (i.e. high order deformations) 35. In contrast, field maps can fail to completely correct geometric distortions, presumably due to limits in the physical model 36. Concatenated eddy current transformation and the deformation field for nonlinear distortion correction were applied to all DTIs. Diffusion tensors were estimated for each subject from the diffusion tensor images using weighted least squares tensor estimation 37. The T2-weighted image was rigidly aligned to the T1-weighted image and the transformation was concatenated with the inverse rigid transformation from B0 image to T2-weighted image. The resulting rigid transformation was applied to the FA image to map onto the T1-weighted structural image space of the subject. The FA image was then mapped onto the standard image space by applying the diffeomorphic mapping estimated in MRI pre-processing. FA images were then smoothed using a Gaussian filter (FWHM=10 mm) in the standard image space.",Adult Male Female Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging Brain Human Multivariate-Analysis Deformation-Morphometry Anisotropy

ark+=b7272=q6rn35sz,"Changes in brain anatomy during the course of PTSD","Longitudinal structural T1-weighted images from middle-aged controls and veterans with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Most patients were Vietnam veterans.  The goal of this study was to determine whether PTSD was associated with an increase in time-related decline in macrostructural brain volume and whether these changes were associated with accelerated cognitive decline. To quantify brain structure, 3 dimensional T1-weighted MRI scans were performed at baseline and again after a minimum of 24 months in 25 patients with PTSD and 22 controls. Longitudinal changes in brain volume were measured using deformation morphometry. For the group as a whole PTSD+ patients did not show significant ongoing brain atrophy compared to PTSD-. PTSD+ patients were then subgrouped into those with decreasing or increasing symptoms. We found little evidence for brain markers of accelerated atrophy in PTSD+ veterans whose symptoms improved over time, with only a small left parietal region showing greater ongoing tissue loss than PTSD-. PTSD patients whose symptoms increased over time showed accelerated atrophy throughout the brain, particularly brainstem and frontal and temporal lobes. Lastly, for the sample as a whole greater rates of brain atrophy were associated with greater rates of decline in verbal memory and delayed facial recognition. Participants: After complete description of the study to the subjects, written informed consent was obtained to a protocol approved by the review boards of both the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs (SFVA) Medical Center. Participants had previously participated in one of two earlier studies examining neuroimaging and neuropsychological correlates of PTSD (Neylan et al., 2004; Samuelson et al., 2006; Schuff et al., 2008; Schuff et al., 2001). When initially studied, participants had given consent to be re-contacted about future studies. Veterans were contacted a minimum of two years after completion of the first assessment. Study procedures included completing a neuropsychological test battery and MRI scanning. Participants met the following basic inclusion criteria at baseline: veterans 25-65 years of age; PTSD+ participants had current PTSD attributable to a traumatic life event (e.g., Vietnam or Gulf War combat, experiencing or witnessing serious accidents, illnesses, sudden death, physical and sexual assault), PTSD- participants had no current, subthreshold, or lifetime history of PTSD. Exclusion criteria at baseline were: diagnosis of drug dependence or abuse within the past 6 months, current or lifetime history of any psychiatric disorder with psychotic features, current or lifetime history of bipolar disorder, history of neurologic or systemic illness affecting CNS function, history of head injury with loss of consciousness exceeding 10 minutes, and history of head injury with any persistent post-injury symptoms. Alcohol abuse and dependence were allowable diagnoses for one of the original studies. Patients and controls were studied twice, once after enrollment (baseline) and again after a minimum of 24 months. Because we were interested in the natural course of PTSD, we did not apply exclusionary criteria at follow-up. At follow-up, three PTSD+ participants met one of the exclusionary baseline diagnosestwo exhibiting psychotic symptoms and one exhibiting symptoms of bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. These participants did not represent outliers in terms of neuropsychological functioning and were included in our previous study of longitudinal neuropsychological functioning (Samuelson et al., 2009), and were also included in this longitudinal imaging study. This analysis included 25 PTSD+ male veterans and 22 PTSD- male veterans that had complete longitudinal MRI and neuropsychological datasets.  Clinical and cognitive testing: Diagnoses of PTSD at baseline and follow-up were made by a clinical psychologist using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, which determines if DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were met (CAPS; (Blake et al., 1995)). Individuals with no trauma exposure received a CAPS score of 0. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnosis (SCID; (First et al., 1996)) was used to diagnose comorbid and exclusionary conditions. Lifetime alcohol use was obtained using the Lifetime Drinking History questionnaire (LDH; (Skinner and Sheu, 1982)).  All participants were administered a test battery of neuropsychological measures at both timepoints, including the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; (Delis et al., 1987)), Faces I, Faces II, Family Pictures I, Family Pictures II, Digit Span and Spatial Span subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition (WMS-III; (Wechsler, 1987)). Samuelson and colleagues previously reported on the longitudinal neuropsychological changes observed in this dataset (Samuelson et al., 2009), and found a subtle decline in delayed facial recognition as indexed by performance on the Faces II subtest. In light of this finding and the previous reports of longitudinal changes on the CVLT due to PTSD (Yehuda et al., 2006), this study focused only on the relationships of longitudinal changes in Faces II, CVLT total (short term verbal memory) and CVLT long delay (long term verbal memory) with longitudinal measures of brain atrophy. Longitudinal change on these neuropsychological tests was defined as (scoretp1-scoretp2)/(test interval in yrs).  MRI acquisition and processing: T1-weighted images were acquired on a clinical 1.5 Tesla MR scanner (Vision, Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin NJ) using Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (TR/TI/TE = 9/300/4 ms, 1x1 mm2 in-plane resolution, 1.5 mm slabs); images were acquired orthogonal to the long axis of the hippocampus.  Deformation based morphometry (DBM) analyses: Robust fluid registration was used to nonlinearly register baseline and follow-up scans of each participant to create maps of longitudinal atrophy. Each participant's baseline image was then registered to an atlas; transformations were combined to create maps of longitudinal atrophy in common space as described in (Cardenas et al., 2007). The longitudinal atrophy maps were normalized by interscan interval and these maps of annualized atrophy rate in common space were used in statistical analysis using linear models. ANCOVA at each voxel was used to test our first hypothesis that PTSD was associated with greater tissue atrophy rates; the maps of longitudinal change were the dependent variable, group status (i.e., PTSD+ or PTSD-) was the categorical predictor, and age was a covariate. Linear regressions with baseline clinical or imaging measures as the independent variable were fit at each voxel in order to identify baseline predictors of ongoing atrophy. Subsequent analyses compared PTSD+ participants with improving symptoms vs. PTSD-, and PTSD+ with worsening symptoms vs. PTSD-, in order to determine the relationship between improving mental health and ongoing brain atrophy. Using all participants, linear regression with change in neuropsychological test score as the independent variable was also fit at each voxel, covarying for age, in order to determine the relationship between rate of tissue atrophy and cognitive decline. Statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons by thresholding at uncorrected p=0.005, identifying suprathreshold clusters, and using nonstationary random field theory (Worsley et al., 2002) to identify clusters with corrected p<0.05. Within each cluster with corrected p<0.05, the estimated effects (i.e., the voxel-wise beta coefficients from the linear model) were averaged to determine the magnitude of the group effects (for ANCOVA models) or the slope (for regression models).",Adult Male Human Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging Brain Deformation-Morphometry Longitudinal Neuropsychological-Testing Stress-Disorders-Post-Traumatic Veterans Vietnamese-Conflict-1961-1975

We were interested in re-analyzing the data because the list of differentially expressed genes that were identified when comparing rapamycin resistant DLBCL cell lines to rapamycin sensitive cell lines was not included in the original article or supplemental materials.  We were interested in validating and expanding upon the findings from the original article by reevaluating the raw microarray data.  Our reanalysis identified over 200 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between rapamycin resistant and sensitive cells.  Importantly, our analysis highlighted a gene that was highly upregulated in rapamycin resistant cells, CD247, that was not the focus on the original publication, and is the target of a drug currently in clinical trials for refractory DLBCL.  Our reanalysis also highlighted the role of SYK, a kinase upregulated in rapamycin resistant cell lines, that has a direct molecular relationship with CD247, and is a potential biomarker of drug response in DLBCL.
